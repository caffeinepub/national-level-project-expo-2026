# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the application to the last known stable working state before recent changes caused issues.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore frontend code to the previously working stable version
- Restore backend code to the previously working stable version
- Ensure the application builds and deploys successfully

**User-visible outcome:** The application works as it did before the recent breaking changes — registration, gallery, admin dashboard, CMS content, admin login, and dashboard data loading all function correctly.
