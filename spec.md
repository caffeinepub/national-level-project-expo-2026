# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the Project Expo 2026 site with a variety of smooth animations and visual polish across all pages and key components.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a fade-in + slide-up page transition animation triggered on every route change (/, /home, /about, /event-details, /check-registration, /gallery)
- Add slowly drifting/pulsing gradient glow orbs as decorative background elements on the Hero section, About page, and Event Details page
- Add a left-to-right shimmer/shine sweep animation on hover to Coordinator section cards
- Add a typewriter effect to the Hero section tagline that plays after the entrance fade-in completes, with a blinking cursor
- Add staggered scale-up + fade-in animations to Admin Dashboard analytics cards on load, with ~100ms incremental delays between cards
- Add a continuously looping expanding ripple/pulse ring animation around the "Register Now" CTA button on the Landing Page and Hero section
- Add a count-up animation to the Hero section registration counter, animating from 0 to the fetched value over ~1.5 seconds
- Add a parallax scrolling effect to the Hero section background so it scrolls slower than the foreground content

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a visually polished site with smooth transitions, engaging animations, and subtle motion effects throughout, while all existing functionality remains intact.
