Add frontend validation to reject login attempts with any other email address. Ensure the email input field displays or pre-populates 'athiakash1977@gmail.com' as the expected admin host email. The existing backend call to verify credentials should remain unchanged, but add a client-side check that blocks submission if the email doesn't match the expected admin email."
