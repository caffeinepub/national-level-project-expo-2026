  "summary": "The diff shows 19 modified files across both frontend and backend. The changes appear to restore/maintain a working state of the application including backend (main.mo), frontend routing (App.tsx), all major pages (HomePage, AdminDashboard, AdminLogin, GalleryPage, RegistrationLookupPage), components (Hero, About, EventDetails, Coordinators, Registration, Navbar, ProtectedRoute, AdminContentManagement), hooks (useQueries.ts), context (AdminAuthContext.tsx), and supporting files. The codebase includes registration, gallery, admin dashboard, CMS content management, and admin login functionality — matching the acceptance criteria. No files were added or removed, only modified, which is consistent with a revert/restore operation. The project_state.json confirms REQ-1 is tracked. Overall the implementation appears to satisfy REQ-1 with no obvious missing requirements or hallucinated features beyond the scope of the build request.",
