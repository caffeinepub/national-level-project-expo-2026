  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-1 (admin email credential), REQ-2 (content management), REQ-3 (registrations tab with search/filter/CSV), and REQ-4 (analytics card + ProtectedRoute) are all substantially addressed. However, the backend admin-only endpoint authorization rejecting non-admin principals relies on AccessControl but the MixinAuthorization integration is only partially visible due to truncation. One hallucinated feature (GalleryManager) is present that was not requested. The REQ-4 AC about redirecting /admin/* while unauthenticated is partially implemented since only /admin/dashboard is wrapped in ProtectedRoute.",
