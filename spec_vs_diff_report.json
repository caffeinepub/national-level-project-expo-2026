  "summary": "The diff implements hash-based routing via createHashHistory in App.tsx to fix the 'Not Found' error on the Internet Computer deployment, adds all required routes, and creates a NotFoundPage component as a catch-all fallback. REQ-1 is fully addressed. REQ-2 is partially addressed through hash routing but no explicit index.html or asset path configuration changes are visible in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the frontend build configuration (index.html and asset paths) supports client-side routing correctly in the Internet Computer deployment environment, so that deep-link navigation and page refreshes do not result in 'Not Found' errors.",
      "reason": "The diff addresses this indirectly via hash-based routing in App.tsx, but no changes to index.html, vite.config, dfx.json, or IC asset canister configuration files are present. Explicit build/deployment config changes are not shown.",
